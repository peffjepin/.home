lines not starting with '#' or "!" are ignored

possible line formattings:

    (A) A 6 DIGIT HEX STRING FOLLOWED BY A CODE [16-255]
        "#hexstr code" -> #0f0f0f 100

    (B) A NAMED COLOR CLASS FOLLOWED BY A COLOR TO DERIVE IT FROM
        "!emphasis red"  --  black red green blue cyan magenta yellow white from base 16
        "!emphasis #hx"  --  6 digit hex literal preceded by '#'
        "!emphasis 100"  --  [0-255] color that had been mapped from (A) format
        
        given an "!emphasis red" line the generator will expand this into
        environment variables with variants like the following:
            $CS_EMPHASIS     --  plain option (set to a value [0-255])
            $CS_EMPHASIS_C   --  *_C increased contrast
            $CS_EMPHASIS_CC  --  *_CC double increased contrast
            $CS_EMPHASIS_c   --  *_c decreased contrast
            $CS_EMPHASIS_cc  --  *_cc double decreased contrast
            $xCS_EMPHASIS_*  --  prefix with 'x' for hex literal value
